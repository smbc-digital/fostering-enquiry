## Philosophy
It has been identified that the process for registering an interest in fostering and the process after are slow and not interactive enough for citizens.

The first part of addressing this is to create an online form to quickly and effectivly gather data from potential foster carers. This can then be passed on and worked with faster ensuring people feel engaged in the process.

## Installation
